## üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Personal Projects
### __Basically all I like to do__

[COVID-19 Tracker](https://romanian-corona-traker.netlify.app)
* I wanted to take my skills and contribute to the crisis the world was facing. This is a web app that fetches real-time data of the numbers regarding COVID-19 victims and visualizes them through a graphic by countries or worldwide (infected, deaths, recovered). 
* The visual data does present nicely, but I had to do a few media queries to optimize it for mobile use.  
* Built with React.js (Front-end) & Node.js (Back-end). 
* Deployed on Netlify. 
* To present the data visually, I used Chart.js. 
* I also used CountUp to add numbers counting up in the card component.

[Is this a human?](https://rusuraluca-facerecognition-brain.netlify.app)
* Web app that detects human faces in an image when provided with the URL image. 
* Deployed on Heroku. To detect human faces I used the Clarifai API. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Tachyons, Particles.js (Front-end) and Node.js, Express, Knex, Bcrypt, SQL, PostgreSQL (Back-end).

[Find the movie](https://codepen.io/raluca-rusu/pen/PoZxEyX)
* This is a simple movie finder app in which you can find information about any movie just by entering its title.
* Used the OMDb API, a RESTful web service, to fetch the movie information.
